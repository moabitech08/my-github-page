<p>Hi! My name is Moabi Ntusa. A first year year student at Botswana Accountancy College. I'm a beginner web developer learning how to use GitHub Pages.This is my first multi-page website, and I'm excited to share it with you! I created this project to practice structuring pages, styling with CSS, and organizing files properly. Every page you see here was built as part of my learning journey.</p>

<p>This is my first multi-page website, and I'm excited to share it with you!

This is a simple webpage hosted on GitHub Pages.

I built this project to practice HTML, CSS, and creating a multi-page website. It helped me learn how to structure pages, add navigation links, and style content.

Here’s a picture of a cute car I added to practice working with images and design.

Thanks for visiting my website as I continue learning and improving my web development skills! 🚀
